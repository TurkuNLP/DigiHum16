    "## Data and background\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suomi24 is the largest Finnish online forum\n",
    "* All 15 years of online Suomi24 discussions have been recently released for researcher use\n",
    "  * XXX sentences / XXX words\n",
    "* *Citizen Mindscapes* - A consortium project funded by the Academy of Finland to dig into the data\n",
    "* Consortium members cover sociology, psychology, statistics, language technology,...\n",

    "## National stereotypes\n",
    "\n",
    "* A question posed to us by Jussi Pakkasvirta (Jussi: you've hereby been acknowledged for the idea!)\n",
    "* **What are the stereotypes about nations in the S24 data?**\n",
    "* In other words: **How do people talk about different nations and countries?**\n",
    "* This is just a use case of a more general approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding distinctive features\n",
    "\n",
    "* The general problem: given two collections of texts one *focus* and the other *background* - what are the features which distinguish focus from background?\n",
    "    * In our example: *focus* texts about a nation *background* texts about all other nations\n",
    "* General problem - General solution\n",

    "## Supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine learning from examples\n",
    "* In goes: examples and their desired output\n",
    "* Out goes: a learned model which can repeat the task on previously unseen examples\n",
    "    * Customer feedback -> positive/negative sentiment\n",
    "    * Photo of an apple -> rotten/edible\n",
    "    * Cell customer data -> will switch provider yes/no\n",
    "    * Weather data -> will rain next hour yes/no\n",
    "    * Movie review -> the number of recommendation stars\n",
    "    * Threatening message -> serious yes/no\n",
    "    * Email -> spam yes/no\n",
    "    * Photograph -> nude people yes/no\n",

    "\n",
    "* General machines which can learn a given *example -> prediction* mapping from examples\n",
    "* Universal, *\"just drop the data in\"* solutions\n",
    "* Each example must be presented to the classifier in the form of **features**\n",
    "* Features are single, measurable properties of the examples\n",
    "    * Customer feedback -> one feature for every unique word\n",
    "    * Photo of an apple -> one feature for every pixel, carrying color information\n",
    "    * Weather data -> set of current atmospheric measurements\n",
    "    * Email -> one feature for every unique word, the domain of the sender\n",
    "    * Stock price -> time series of past prices, one feature for every word in news pieces mentioning the company in today's news\n",
    "    * ...\n",
    "* In its simplest form, a classifier learns a weight for every feature\n",
    "* ...which happens to be the same thing as drawing a line across the space and saying that everything above the line is one class, and everything below the line is the other class\n",
    "    * one feature -> we set a cut-off point\n",
    "    * two features -> we draw a line\n",
    "    * three features -> we draw a plane\n",
    "    * four and more features -> hyperplane\n",
