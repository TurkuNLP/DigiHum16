    "\n",
    "## Data and background\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suomi24 is the largest Finnish online forum\n",
    "* All 15 years of online Suomi24 discussions have been recently released for researcher use\n",
    "  * 2.3 billion words\n",
    "  * Fully syntactically parsed: [try here](http://epsilon-it.utu.fi/dep_search/?db=Suomi24&search=L%3Dtsekki) and of course in Korp [here](https://korp.csc.fi/#?prequery_within=sentence&cqp=[]&corpus=s24_001,s24_002,s24_003,s24_004,s24_005,s24_006,s24_007,s24_008,s24_009&search=lemgram|Brasilia..nn.1&page=0)\n",

    "## National stereotypes\n",
    "\n",
    "* A question posed to us by Jussi Pakkasvirta (Thanks, Jussi!)\n",
    "* **What are the stereotypes about nations in the S24 data?**\n",
    "* In other words: **How do people talk about different nations and countries?**\n",
    "* This is just a use case of a more general approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding distinctive features\n",
    "\n",
    "* The general problem: given two collections of texts one *focus* and the other *background* - what are the features which distinguish focus from background?\n",
    "    * In our example: *focus* texts about a nation *background* texts about all other nations\n",
    "* Quick way to the goal:\n",
    "    * Train a classifier to distinguish sentences mentioning one nation, vs all other nations\n",
    "    * Heavily L1-regularize to get only a small number of non-zero features\n",
    "    * Cash in results :)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Nations and countries\n",
    "\n",
    "* A list of nations and their names is needed\n",
    "* Semi-manual work, starting from an online list\n",
    "* Coverage not perfect, but quite OK (164 entries)\n",
    "* Semi-manually expanded also to include nations not just countries\n",
    "* Looks like this:\n",

    "* Bummer: the list is not that great and the translations suck :(\n",
    "* For each nation, we can reduce the data only to hits of these sentiment words, and pick the most distinctive ones once again\n",
    "* This gets pretty sparse, so some countries don't get a sentiment --- need a better sentiment dictionary!\n",
    "* Having selected the most distinctive sentiment terms for each nation, we can aggregate a total sentiment for each, weighted by the (log of the) number of hits of the sentiment words\n",
